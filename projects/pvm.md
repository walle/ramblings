PHP version manager, a small bash script to manage multiple PHP versions.

This script is not at all complete and not very well tested. So I would not recommend anyone to use it in production.
Perhaps not even on your main development PC if you rely on PHP.

Losely modeled after [RVM](http://rvm.io), but not at all as complex or powerful.
